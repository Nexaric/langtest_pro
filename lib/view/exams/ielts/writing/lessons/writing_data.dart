          'Some people believe that technology makes life more convenient, while others argue it complicates life. Discuss both views and give your opinion.',
      'sampleAnswer': '''
üìù Sample Answer (170 words)

Technology's role in contemporary life is debated. Some argue it simplifies tasks, such as online banking reducing queues, or apps streamlining communication. Conversely, critics claim technology adds stress, like constant notifications fragmenting focus or cyber threats risking privacy.

While technology can overwhelm, its benefits outweigh drawbacks. Innovations like medical AI save lives, and remote work tools improve productivity. The key is mindful usage‚Äîsetting screen-time limits or using ad-blockers to minimize distractions.

In conclusion, technology's convenience dominates when used responsibly. Rather than blaming devices, users should adapt habits to harness advantages without succumbing to pitfalls.

      'question':
          'Some say students should study only practical subjects like science and math, while others believe creative arts are equally important. Discuss both sides and give your view.',
      'sampleAnswer': '''
üìù Sample Answer (185 words)

STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, math) are often prioritized for job readiness, as they teach skills like coding or data analysis. However, arts foster creativity‚Äîgraphic design nurtures innovation, and drama builds confidence.

While STEM fields dominate industries like tech, arts develop adaptable thinkers. For instance, Apple's success blends engineering (STEM) and design (arts). Eliminating arts risks creating narrowly skilled graduates.

I believe a balanced curriculum is ideal. Schools should integrate both: math classes could include architectural design projects, bridging logic and creativity. This prepares students for diverse careers while nurturing well-rounded minds.

      'title': 'Advantages of Remote Work',
      'icon': Iconsax.briefcase,
      'question':
          'Some people believe that remote work offers significant advantages, while others argue it has drawbacks. Discuss both views and give your opinion.',
      'sampleAnswer': '''
üìù Sample Answer (180 words)

Remote work provides flexibility, allowing employees to manage their schedules and reduce commuting time. Tools like Zoom enable seamless collaboration, and studies show productivity often increases. However, isolation can affect mental health, and distractions at home may hinder focus.

In my opinion, remote work is beneficial if managed well. Companies should offer hybrid models, combining office and home work to balance collaboration and flexibility. Employees must set boundaries to avoid burnout.

In conclusion, remote work's advantages outweigh its challenges with proper strategies in place.
