    'passage': '''
The transition to renewable energy is reshaping global energy systems, driven by climate change concerns and depleting fossil fuel reserves. Solar power, harnessing sunlight through photovoltaic panels, has surged, with costs dropping 80% since 2010. Wind energy, captured by turbines, thrives in coastal and high-altitude regions, contributing 8% of global electricity. Hydropower, using dammed rivers, remains a stable renewable source, though environmental impacts, like ecosystem disruption, spark debate. Geothermal energy taps Earth’s heat, offering consistent power in volcanic areas, while biomass converts organic waste into fuel, reducing landfill use. Innovations like floating solar farms and offshore wind turbines maximize efficiency and land use. In 2023, renewables accounted for 30% of global electricity, with countries like Denmark leading, generating over 50% from wind and solar. Battery storage, critical for intermittent sources, has improved, with lithium-ion technology enabling grid stability. Hydrogen, produced via renewable-powered electrolysis, is emerging as a clean fuel for heavy industry and transport. However, challenges persist—high initial costs, land use conflicts, and recycling turbine blades pose hurdles. Developing nations, reliant on coal, face financing gaps for renewable projects, exacerbating energy inequality. Policy incentives, such as subsidies and carbon taxes, accelerate adoption, while international agreements like the Paris Accord push for net-zero emissions by 2050. Community-led projects, like solar cooperatives, empower local economies. Critics argue renewables cannot yet meet constant energy demands, requiring hybrid systems with natural gas as a bridge. Technological advancements, including perovskite solar cells and enhanced geothermal systems, promise greater efficiency. Renewable energy not only mitigates climate change but also creates jobs, with over 12 million employed globally in the sector. Scaling renewables requires global cooperation, innovative financing, and public support to ensure a sustainable, equitable energy future, balancing environmental goals with economic realities.
