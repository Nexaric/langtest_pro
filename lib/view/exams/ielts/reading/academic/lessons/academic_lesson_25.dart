    'passage': '''
Wetlands, transitional ecosystems between land and water, are vital for biodiversity, climate regulation, and human well-being. Covering 6% of Earth’s surface, they support 40% of global species, including migratory birds and amphibians. Wetlands act as natural filters, purifying 60% of water passing through, reducing pollutants. They store carbon, sequestering 30% more than forests, mitigating climate change. Coastal wetlands, like mangroves, protect against storms, saving 50 billion annually in damages. Economically, they support fisheries, with 70% of global fish species relying on them. Rice paddies, a wetland type, feed 3 billion people. However, 35% of wetlands have been lost since 1970, driven by agriculture, urbanization, and drainage. Pollution, like fertilizers, affects 50% of wetlands, causing algal blooms. Climate change, raising sea levels, threatens 20% of coastal wetlands. Invasive species, like water hyacinth, disrupt 15% of ecosystems. Restoration, like the Everglades project, has recovered 10,000 hectares, improving water flow. Constructed wetlands treat wastewater, handling 25% of urban runoff. Community management, as in Bangladesh, engages 5 million locals, enhancing conservation. Technology, like drones, monitors degradation, increasing efficiency by 30%. Policy frameworks, such as the Ramsar Convention, protect 2,400 sites, but enforcement is weak, with 40% of sites degraded. Economic incentives, like carbon credits, fund restoration, generating 1 billion yearly. Challenges include funding gaps, with only 5% of global conservation budgets for wetlands, and land-use conflicts, as agriculture competes for space. Public awareness, with 60% unaware of wetland benefits, limits support. Wetlands’ role in flood control, biodiversity, and food security underscores their value, requiring global efforts to restore, protect, and educate for sustainable management and resilience in a changing climate.
