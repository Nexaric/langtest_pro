    'passage': '''
Coral reefs, often called the rainforests of the sea, are vibrant ecosystems supporting 25% of marine life despite covering less than 0.1% of ocean floors. Built by calcium carbonate secretions from tiny animals called polyps, reefs thrive in warm, shallow waters. They provide habitats for fish, mollusks, and crustaceans, fostering biodiversity. Reefs protect coastal ecosystems, acting as natural barriers against erosion and storms, saving billions in damages annually. Economically, they support fisheries and tourism, generating 36 billion yearly. However, reefs face severe threats. Climate change, causing ocean warming, triggers coral bleaching, with 50% of reefs lost since 1950. Ocean acidification, from absorbed carbon dioxide, weakens coral structures. Overfishing disrupts food chains, while pollution, like plastic and agricultural runoff, smothers reefs. Destructive practices, such as dynamite fishing, devastate habitats. Restoration efforts, including coral gardening and artificial reefs, show promise—nurseries in Australia have replanted thousands of corals. Marine protected areas, covering 8% of oceans, limit human impact, though enforcement varies. Technology, like 3D-printed coral structures, aids regeneration, but scaling remains costly. Local communities, dependent on reefs, lead conservation, with initiatives in Indonesia training fishers in sustainable practices. Global agreements, like the Coral Reef Alliance, push for emissions reductions to curb warming. Reefs also hold medical potential, with compounds used in cancer treatments. Preserving reefs requires addressing climate change, enforcing protections, and engaging communities, ensuring these ecosystems continue supporting marine life, coastal protection, and human livelihoods in a warming world.
