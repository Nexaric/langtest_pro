    'passage': '''
Citizen science, engaging the public in scientific research, democratizes knowledge and accelerates discovery. Since the 1990s, projects like Galaxy Zoo, classifying 1 million galaxies, have involved 500,000 volunteers globally. Participants collect data, from bird counts to air quality, contributing 30% of environmental research. In 2023, 2 million citizens participated, with apps like iNaturalist logging 50 million observations. Citizen science aids conservation, with 20% of protected areas relying on volunteer data. In Australia, frog monitoring by 10,000 citizens informs wetland policies. Health research benefits, with 15% of COVID-19 studies using public input on symptoms. Urban planning uses crowd-sourced data, improving 25% of city traffic systems. Educationally, 70% of participants gain STEM skills, inspiring careers. Low-cost tools, like 50 air sensors, enable participation, though 40% of projects lack funding. Accessibility issues exclude 30% of rural communities, with internet gaps. Data quality, questioned by 20% of scientists, requires validation, with AI improving accuracy by 35%. Ethical concerns, like privacy, affect 10% of health projects, necessitating consent protocols. Citizen science bridges science and society, with 80% of volunteers feeling empowered. Policy integration, like the EU’s citizen science framework, supports 200 projects, but global coordination lags. Climate research, with 50% of data from citizens, tracks warming impacts. Challenges include sustaining engagement, with 25% of volunteers dropping out, and ensuring inclusivity. Technology, like drones, enhances data collection, but costs limit use to 5% of projects. Citizen science’s impact, from biodiversity to public health, underscores its value, requiring investment, training, and ethical standards to maximize contributions and foster global scientific collaboration.
