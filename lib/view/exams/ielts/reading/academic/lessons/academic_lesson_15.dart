    'passage': '''
Urbanization, the shift from rural to urban living, has accelerated globally, with 56% of the world’s population now city-dwellers. Cities drive economic growth, concentrating resources, innovation, and infrastructure. Urban areas generate 80% of global GDP, fueled by industries, services, and technology hubs. However, rapid urbanization strains resources, causing housing shortages, with 1.6 billion people living in inadequate conditions. Traffic congestion and air pollution, from vehicle emissions, degrade quality of life—cities like Delhi face severe smog crises. Urban sprawl encroaches on ecosystems, reducing biodiversity by 30% in some regions. Social inequality widens, as slums expand alongside luxury developments. Solutions include smart cities, using IoT to optimize energy and transport, like Singapore’s traffic systems. Green spaces, such as urban parks, improve mental health and reduce heat islands. Affordable housing initiatives, like Brazil’s Minha Casa, address shortages. Public transport, including metro systems, cuts emissions, though funding remains a barrier. Urban planning emphasizes sustainability, with compact city models minimizing sprawl. Community engagement ensures inclusive development, empowering residents in decisions. However, corruption and poor governance hinder progress, especially in developing nations. Climate change exacerbates challenges, with rising sea levels threatening coastal cities like Miami. Resilient infrastructure, like flood barriers, is critical. Urbanization offers opportunities for cultural exchange, with diverse populations fostering creativity, but social tensions arise from integration issues. Balancing growth with sustainability requires innovation, equitable policies, and global cooperation to create livable, resilient urban futures.
