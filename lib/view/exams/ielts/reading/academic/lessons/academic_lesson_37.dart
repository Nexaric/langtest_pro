    'passage': '''
Genetic engineering, manipulating DNA to enhance organisms, is revolutionizing medicine, agriculture, and industry. Since the 1970s, techniques like CRISPR have enabled precise edits, with 90% accuracy in targeting genes. In medicine, gene therapies treat 5,000 rare diseases, benefiting 10 million patients, with 80% success in trials for sickle cell anemia. Cancer treatments, like CAR-T therapy, boost survival by 50% for 1 million patients. In agriculture, genetically modified crops, grown on 190 million hectares, increase yields by 20%, feeding 800 million. Drought-resistant varieties, used in 30% of African farms, cut losses by 25%. Bioengineered microbes produce 10% of insulin globally, supporting 500 million diabetics. Industrial applications, like enzyme production, reduce chemical waste by 30%, saving 5 billion yearly. Gene drives, altering 70% of mosquito populations, reduce malaria cases by 20%, protecting 200 million. However, challenges persist. Ethical concerns, with 60% opposing human gene editing, spark debates, especially on designer babies. Biosafety risks, like unintended mutations, affect 5% of trials, threatening ecosystems. Regulatory gaps, with 40% of nations lacking oversight, allow untested products, as seen in China’s CRISPR babies. Costs, averaging 2 million per therapy, exclude 80% of low-income patients. Public skepticism, with 50% distrusting GMOs, slows adoption, despite 90% safety in studies. Environmental impacts, like crossbreeding, affect 10% of wild species. Innovations, like AI-guided CRISPR, improve precision by 15%, while synthetic biology creates 5% of biofuels. Policy frameworks, like the EU’s GMO laws, regulate 70% of products, but enforcement varies. Developing nations, with 20% of biotech capacity, need 10 billion to scale up. Education, reaching 100 million, reduces stigma by 30%. Global cooperation, like the WHO’s gene-editing guidelines, aligns 80% of nations, but 20% ignore them. Genetic engineering’s potential—health, food security, and sustainability—requires ethical consensus, robust regulation, and equitable access to balance innovation with safety and public trust for a transformative future.
