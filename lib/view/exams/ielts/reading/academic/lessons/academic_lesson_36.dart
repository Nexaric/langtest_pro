    'passage': '''
Indigenous knowledge, accumulated over millennia, offers sustainable solutions to environmental and social challenges. Held by 476 million Indigenous peoples across 90 countries, it integrates ecology, culture, and spirituality. For 80% of Indigenous groups, oral traditions preserve knowledge, like Australia’s Aboriginal fire management, reducing wildfires by 40%. In the Amazon, 70% of plant-based medicines derive from Indigenous practices, benefiting 4 billion people. Agroecological techniques, used by 60% of Indigenous farmers, increase yields by 20% without chemicals, supporting 500 million smallholders. In Arctic communities, 90% rely on traditional navigation, aiding climate research with 30% of sea-ice data. Indigenous governance, managing 25% of global land, protects 80% of biodiversity, as seen in Canada’s Indigenous Protected Areas. Sacred sites, covering 15% of forests, preserve ecosystems, with 50% of global carbon stocks in Indigenous lands. Knowledge sharing, through 10,000 community projects, enhances resilience, like Pacific islanders’ cyclone-resistant crops. However, challenges abound. Colonialism erased 30% of Indigenous languages, threatening 20% of knowledge systems. Land grabs, affecting 40% of Indigenous territories, displace 50 million, as in Brazil’s Amazon. Intellectual property laws exclude 70% of traditional knowledge, enabling biopiracy, with 25% of pharmaceuticals exploiting Indigenous resources. Climate change, impacting 80% of Indigenous lands, disrupts practices, like Inuit hunting routes, affecting 10% of food security. Technology, like digital archives, preserves 5% of oral traditions, but 60% of communities lack internet. Policy recognition, like the UN’s Indigenous Rights Declaration, supports 200 million, but 50% of nations ignore it. Education, integrating Indigenous knowledge in 10% of schools, empowers 1 million youth, though 30% face cultural bias. Economic marginalization, with 70% of Indigenous peoples in poverty, limits advocacy. Global partnerships, like the 1 billion Indigenous Fund, aid conservation, but 20% of funds are mismanaged. Public awareness, with 60% unaware of Indigenous contributions, hinders support. Indigenous knowledge’s value—sustainability, biodiversity, and resilience—demands respect, legal protection, and inclusion, balancing modern science with traditional wisdom to address global crises and foster equitable, sustainable futures.
