Space tourism, the commercialization of space travel for recreation, transforms space access for private citizens, though high costs and technical challenges persist. Rooted in science fiction by authors like Jules Verne, the concept gained traction during the 1960s Space Race, inspiring visions of civilian spaceflight.

Early efforts in the 1980s proposed space hotels, but costs and risks, highlighted by the 1986 Challenger disaster, stalled progress. In the 1990s, Space Adventures enabled private citizens to visit the International Space Station (ISS) via Soyuz spacecraft, with tourists paying millions for orbital stays.

Suborbital tourism offers brief weightlessness and Earth views at lower costs. Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShipTwo, launched from a mothership, and Blue Origin’s New Shepard, a vertical rocket, reach over 100 kilometers. Orbital tourism advanced with SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft, as seen in the 2021 Inspiration4 mission.

Space hotels, planned as commercial stations, promise extended orbital stays with enhanced amenities. Technical challenges include designing user-friendly spacecraft, reliable life support, and safe reentry systems for untrained passengers.

Safety is critical, with accidents underscoring risks. Regulatory frameworks, like the FAA’s, evolve to ensure safety while fostering innovation. Environmental concerns arise from rocket emissions and space debris, prompting sustainability debates.

Space tourism creates jobs and may reduce space access costs through innovation. The customer experience, including training and the “overview effect,” is tailored for comfort. Future possibilities include lunar trips and point-to-point Earth travel.
