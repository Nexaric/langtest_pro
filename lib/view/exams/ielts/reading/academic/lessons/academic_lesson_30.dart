    'passage': '''
Ocean acidification, caused by increased carbon dioxide absorption, threatens marine ecosystems and global economies. Oceans absorb 25% of CO2 emissions, lowering pH by 0.1 units since the 1800s, a 30% acidity increase. This harms calcifying organisms, like corals and shellfish, with 50% of reefs at risk by 2050. Shellfish harvests, worth 10 billion annually, face 20% declines, affecting 1 billion people reliant on seafood. Coral bleaching, exacerbated by acidification, disrupts 25% of marine species, collapsing food chains. Coastal economies, with 40% of global GDP from ocean-related industries, lose 1 trillion yearly by 2100 if unaddressed. Acidification alters fish behavior, reducing survival by 15%. Phytoplankton, producing 50% of oxygen, face growth declines, impacting air quality. Deep-sea ecosystems, like cold-water corals, dissolve, with 10% already damaged. Mitigation includes reducing emissions, with Paris Agreement targets cutting impacts by 20%. Marine protected areas, covering 8% of oceans, buffer ecosystems, though enforcement fails in 30% of sites. Alkalinity enhancement, adding minerals to neutralize acid, shows promise, restoring 5% of test sites. Technology, like carbon capture, reduces CO2 by 10%, but costs 100 per ton. Community efforts, like oyster restoration in the US, boost resilience, supporting 10,000 jobs. Policy incentives, like 5 billion in UN funding, support research, but global coordination lags. Public awareness, with 60% unaware of acidification, limits action. Education campaigns, reaching 20 million, raise support. Acidification’s cascading effects demand urgent action, integrating science, policy, and community efforts to protect marine life, economies, and planetary health, ensuring sustainable oceans for future generations.
