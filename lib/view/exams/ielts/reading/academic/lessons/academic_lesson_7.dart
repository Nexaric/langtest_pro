    'passage': '''
Space exploration, propelled by satellites, has transformed our understanding of the universe and daily life on Earth. Since the launch of Sputnik in 1957, satellites have revolutionized communication, navigation, and scientific research. Orbiting platforms enable global internet access, monitor weather patterns, and track climate change impacts, such as melting ice caps. The Hubble Space Telescope, launched in 1990, captures images of distant galaxies, revealing the cosmos’ vastness and aiding cosmological studies. Satellites support GPS, guiding everything from smartphones to military operations with pinpoint accuracy. Private companies like SpaceX have reduced launch costs through reusable rockets, making space more accessible. Satellites provide real-time data for disaster response, helping coordinate relief efforts during hurricanes or earthquakes. However, orbital debris, from defunct satellites, risks collisions, threatening space sustainability. International cooperation, through treaties and organizations, manages space traffic to prevent conflicts. Challenges include high costs and radiation risks for satellites. Future missions aim for lunar bases and Mars exploration, driven by innovations in propulsion and AI. Satellites also inspire technological advancements, from telecommunications to environmental monitoring, shaping a connected and informed world while pushing humanity toward new frontiers in space.
