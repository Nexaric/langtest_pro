    'passage': '''
Renewable energy, harnessing natural resources like solar, wind, and hydro, is reshaping global energy systems. By 2024, renewables accounted for 30% of electricity, with solar and wind growing 15% annually. Solar panels, now 80% cheaper than in 2010, produce 1,000 gigawatts globally, powering 500 million homes. Wind farms, generating 900 gigawatts, thrive offshore, with Europe leading at 50% of global capacity. Hydropower, supplying 16% of electricity, supports 1 billion people, though dam construction disrupts 20% of river ecosystems. Geothermal and biomass contribute 5% of renewables, with Iceland sourcing 70% of energy from geothermal. Renewables cut emissions by 7 gigatons yearly, mitigating climate change. Jobs in the sector reached 12 million, with China employing 40% of workers. Energy storage, like lithium-ion batteries, stores 10% of renewable output, addressing intermittency. Green hydrogen, produced via electrolysis, fuels 5% of heavy industry, reducing emissions by 20%. However, challenges persist. Renewables require 15% of global critical minerals, like cobalt, causing supply chain issues. Land use conflicts affect 10% of projects, with wind farms impacting bird migration. High initial costs, averaging 2 million per megawatt, deter investment in Africa, where 600 million lack electricity. Grid upgrades, needed for 50% of renewable integration, cost 500 billion globally. Policy support, like the US’s Inflation Reduction Act, offers 370 billion in subsidies, but 30% of nations lack renewable targets. Technological advances, like perovskite solar cells, boost efficiency by 25%, while floating wind farms access 80% more wind resources. Community projects, like India’s 1,000 solar villages, empower 5 million people. Public support, with 70% favoring renewables, drives adoption, though 20% oppose local projects due to aesthetics. International cooperation, like the Paris Agreement, aligns 90% of nations on net-zero goals, but enforcement varies. Developing nations, with 40% of renewable potential, need 100 billion yearly to scale up. Renewables’ growth signals a sustainable future, but overcoming barriers—cost, infrastructure, and equity—requires innovation, investment, and global commitment to balance energy access with environmental protection.
