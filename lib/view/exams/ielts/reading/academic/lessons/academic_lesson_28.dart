    'passage': '''
Food security, ensuring consistent access to nutritious food, is critical as the global population nears 10 billion by 2050. Currently, 800 million people face hunger, with 30% of food wasted annually. Climate change, reducing yields by 10% per degree of warming, threatens crops, while 20% of arable land is degraded. Innovations like precision agriculture, using sensors and AI, boost efficiency by 25%, optimizing water and fertilizers. Vertical farming, growing crops in urban towers, saves 90% of water, producing 100 tons per hectare yearly. Lab-grown meat, cultured from cells, cuts emissions by 80%, with 2 billion invested globally. Genetic modification, like drought-resistant maize, increases yields by 15%, aiding Africa’s 200 million food-insecure. Aquaculture, supplying 50% of seafood, reduces pressure on oceans, though 30% of fish farms pollute. Blockchain tracks supply chains, reducing fraud by 20%. Community gardens, covering 5% of urban land, enhance local access. However, challenges include high costs—vertical farms cost 1 million per hectare—and unequal access, with 60% of tech unavailable to small farmers. Policy gaps, with 40% of nations lacking food security plans, hinder progress. Conflicts disrupt 25% of global food supply, as seen in Ukraine. Subsidies, like India’s 50 billion for farmers, support 500 million, but inefficiencies persist. Education, teaching sustainable practices, reaches 10% of rural farmers. International aid, like the UN’s 10 billion fund, addresses crises, but long-term solutions lag. Consumer trends, with 30% choosing plant-based diets, reduce environmental impact. Food security requires integrating technology, equitable policies, and global cooperation to ensure sustainable, accessible nutrition for all, balancing innovation with affordability and resilience.
