    'passage': '''
The printing press, invented by Johannes Gutenberg around 1440, transformed knowledge dissemination, marking a pivotal moment in history. Before its invention, books were laboriously hand-copied by scribes, making them expensive and accessible only to the wealthy elite, such as clergy or nobility. Gutenberg’s movable type system, using individual metal letters, enabled mass production of texts, drastically reducing costs. The Gutenberg Bible, completed in 1455, was the first major book printed, showcasing the technology’s potential. By 1500, millions of books circulated in Europe, fueling the Renaissance’s intellectual revival and the Reformation’s religious debates. Literacy rates soared as books became affordable, empowering ordinary people to access knowledge. The press challenged traditional authorities, as ideas spread rapidly through pamphlets and books. It also standardized texts, preserving languages and fostering cultural unity. Later innovations, like steam-powered presses in the 19th century, further increased efficiency, producing newspapers and novels at unprecedented scales. Despite initial resistance from scribes fearing job loss, the press’s impact was unstoppable. Its influence extended to science, enabling widespread sharing of discoveries, and to governance, supporting legal and administrative records. The printing press laid the foundation for modern education and communication, with its legacy enduring in today’s digital publishing era, shaping societies globally.
