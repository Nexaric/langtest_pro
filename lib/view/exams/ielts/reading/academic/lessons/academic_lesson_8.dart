    'passage': '''
The deep ocean, below 200 meters where sunlight fades, hosts a remarkable array of marine life adapted to extreme conditions. Creatures like anglerfish use bioluminescence, a chemical glow, to lure prey in the darkness, while giant squid navigate with acute senses. Hydrothermal vents, discovered in 1977, sustain unique ecosystems where microbes and tubeworms thrive on chemosynthesis, using chemical energy instead of sunlight. These vents, found along mid-ocean ridges, release mineral-rich water, supporting dense communities in high-pressure, high-temperature environments. Deep-sea mining for rare metals threatens these fragile habitats, disrupting ecosystems. Plastic pollution, including microplastics, harms species, with over 800 marine animals affected by ingestion or entanglement. Overfishing depletes populations, like deep-sea cod, impacting food chains. Exploration via submersibles and remotely operated vehicles reveals new species, with thousands discovered since the 1980s. However, human activities increase pressure on these ecosystems. Marine reserves and international agreements, like the UN’s High Seas Treaty, aim to protect deep oceans. These ecosystems regulate global temperatures by storing carbon, informing climate science. Preserving them ensures biodiversity and reveals life’s resilience, offering insights into survival in Earth’s harshest environments.
