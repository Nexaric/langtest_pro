    'passage': '''
Artificial photosynthesis, mimicking plants’ ability to convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into energy, offers a sustainable solution to energy and environmental challenges. Unlike solar panels, which generate electricity, this technology produces fuels like hydrogen or ethanol, storing energy for transport and industry. Since its development in the 2010s, efficiency has risen to 15%, rivaling natural photosynthesis. Catalysts, like cobalt-based materials, split water into hydrogen and oxygen, while engineered bacteria convert CO2 into fuels. The process captures 10% of industrial emissions, reducing greenhouse gases. Pilot projects, like Japan’s 2023 initiative, produce 1,000 liters of fuel daily. Artificial photosynthesis could replace 20% of fossil fuels by 2050, cutting emissions by 5 gigatons annually. It supports circular economies, using waste CO2 from factories. In agriculture, it creates carbon-neutral fertilizers, boosting yields by 12%. Developing nations, with abundant sunlight, could benefit, with Africa’s solar potential 50% higher than Europe’s. However, challenges include high costs—systems cost 500 per square meter—and scalability, with only 0.1% of global energy from this tech. Catalyst durability, degrading after 1,000 hours, limits commercial use. Research, funded by 2 billion globally, focuses on nanomaterials to improve efficiency. Public skepticism, with 30% doubting scalability, slows investment. Environmental risks, like catalyst leakage, threaten ecosystems, though biodegradable alternatives are emerging. Policy support, like EU’s Green Deal, offers subsidies, but inconsistent regulations hinder progress. Collaboration, such as US-China research hubs, accelerates innovation. Applications extend to space exploration, powering Mars missions with CO2-rich atmospheres. Artificial photosynthesis aligns with net-zero goals, promising clean energy, reduced emissions, and economic benefits, but requires investment, technological breakthroughs, and global cooperation to overcome barriers and achieve widespread adoption.
