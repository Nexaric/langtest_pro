    'passage': '''
The global water crisis threatens billions, as freshwater scarcity escalates due to population growth, climate change, and mismanagement. Over 2 billion people lack access to clean water, leading to health crises and economic challenges. Rising temperatures and droughts deplete groundwater reserves, while industrial and agricultural pollution contaminates rivers and lakes. Unsafe water spreads diseases like cholera, claiming millions of lives annually, particularly in developing nations. Agriculture, consuming 70% of global freshwater, exacerbates shortages, threatening food security as crops fail. For example, regions like Sub-Saharan Africa face declining yields due to water scarcity. Solutions include desalination, which converts seawater to freshwater, but high costs limit its scalability. Rainwater harvesting captures runoff, though infrastructure demands are significant. Efficient irrigation systems, like drip technology, reduce waste, while water recycling reuses wastewater for industry or agriculture. Community-led initiatives, such as watershed protection, empower local solutions, restoring ecosystems. Wealthier nations can support equitable access through funding and technology transfers, as seen in projects in India and Kenya. Policy reforms, like stricter pollution controls, are critical to curb contamination. The crisis demands global cooperation to ensure water security, protect ecosystems, and safeguard human health for future generations, balancing technological innovation with sustainable practices.
