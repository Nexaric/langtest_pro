    'passage': '''
Migration, the movement of people across borders, shapes cultures, economies, and identities. In 2023, 281 million people, or 3.6% of the global population, were migrants, driven by conflict, economics, and climate change. Migration enriches societies, with 40% of urban populations in developed nations being first- or second-generation migrants. Cultural exchange, like food and music, transforms cities—70% of global cuisines blend migrant influences. In London, 50% of restaurants serve hybrid dishes, boosting economies by 10 billion yearly. Migrants contribute 20% of patents in tech hubs, driving innovation. Remittances, totaling 700 billion annually, support 800 million people in developing nations, with India receiving 100 billion. Migration fosters diversity, with 60% of schools in multicultural cities teaching multiple languages. However, challenges arise. Cultural clashes, reported by 30% of communities, fuel tensions, as seen in Europe’s integration debates. Xenophobia affects 25% of migrants, limiting opportunities. Brain drain, with 15% of skilled workers leaving developing nations, hinders growth, as seen in Africa’s healthcare sector. Integration policies, like Canada’s, succeed in 80% of cases, but 40% of nations lack such frameworks. Language barriers, affecting 50% of migrants, slow assimilation, with 20% unable to access education. Economic disparities, with migrants earning 30% less on average, persist. Technology, like translation apps, aids 35% of migrants, while online platforms connect 10 million to jobs. Community programs, like Germany’s mentorship schemes, support 1 million migrants yearly. Policy reforms, like the UN’s Migration Compact, promote rights, but 30% of nations ignore it. Climate migration, displacing 50 million, strains resources, with 20% of Pacific islands at risk. Public perception, with 40% viewing migration negatively, complicates integration. Education campaigns, reaching 200 million, reduce prejudice by 15%. Migration’s benefits—innovation, diversity, and growth—require balanced policies, cultural sensitivity, and global cooperation to address challenges, ensuring inclusive societies that embrace change while fostering cohesion and equity.
