    'passage': '''
Urban planning, designing cities for sustainability and livability, has evolved since ancient grid systems like Mohenjo-Daro. Today, 55% of the global population, or 4.4 billion, live in cities, projected to reach 70% by 2050. Urban sprawl, expanding 30% faster than population growth, consumes 10% of arable land, threatening food security. Smart cities, using IoT and AI, optimize 20% of resources, with Singapore reducing commuting by 15%. Green spaces, covering 10% of urban areas, lower temperatures by 5°C, improving health for 60% of residents. Public transport, serving 50% of city dwellers, cuts emissions by 2 gigatons yearly. Mixed-use developments, integrating housing and commerce, reduce travel by 25%, boosting local economies by 15%. Affordable housing, lacking for 1.6 billion, fuels slums, with 25% of urbanites in informal settlements. Participatory planning, engaging 30% of residents, enhances equity, as seen in Bogotá’s community-led designs. Technology, like 3D mapping, improves infrastructure by 20%, though costs exclude 40% of low-income cities. Climate resilience, with 70% of cities at risk of flooding, drives adaptation, like Rotterdam’s water plazas, managing 10 million liters. Policy frameworks, like the UN’s New Urban Agenda, guide 80% of urban plans, but 30% of cities lack funding. Gentrification, displacing 15% of low-income residents, sparks debate, with 50% of projects prioritizing profit. Walkable cities, like Copenhagen, increase foot traffic by 40%, supporting businesses. Urban agriculture, on 5% of city land, feeds 700 million, enhancing food security. Challenges include inequality, with 20% of urban wealth held by 1%, and governance, with 25% of cities facing corruption. Public support, with 65% favoring sustainable cities, drives change, though 20% resist densification. Urban planning’s future lies in balancing growth, equity, and resilience, integrating technology and community input to create inclusive, sustainable cities for a rapidly urbanizing world.
