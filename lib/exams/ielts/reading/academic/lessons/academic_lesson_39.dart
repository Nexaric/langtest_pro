    'passage': '''
Social movements, collective efforts for change, shape societies and policies. From the 1960s Civil Rights Movement to #MeToo, they address inequality, justice, and rights. In 2023, 500 million participated in global protests, with 70% seeking systemic change. Digital platforms, used by 80% of activists, amplify voices, with 1 billion social media posts yearly driving awareness. The Civil Rights Movement, mobilizing 6 million, led to the 1964 Act, reducing racial discrimination by 50%. Climate movements, like Fridays for Future, engage 20 million, pressuring 60% of nations to adopt net-zero targets. Feminist movements, with 200 million supporters, increase gender equality laws by 30%, benefiting 2 billion women. Labor movements, involving 100 million workers, secure 20% higher wages in 40% of cases. Grassroots campaigns, like India’s farmers’ protests, influence 70% of local policies, impacting 500 million. Nonviolent strategies, used in 90% of movements, succeed 50% more than violent ones. Technology, like encrypted apps, protects 30% of activists, though 20% face surveillance. Crowdfunding, raising 1 billion, funds 10,000 campaigns yearly. Challenges include repression, with 25% of activists arrested, and polarization, with 40% of movements facing public backlash. Funding disparities, with 60% of resources to high-income nations, limit 80% of grassroots efforts. Misinformation, affecting 30% of campaigns, undermines credibility, as seen in anti-vaccine protests. Policy impact, with 50% of movements influencing laws, varies, with 30% of governments resisting change. Community organizing, training 50 million, boosts success by 25%. Global networks, like Amnesty International, support 10 million activists, but 20% of nations restrict NGOs. Public support, with 60% favoring movements, drives change, though 30% oppose radical tactics. Education, reaching 200 million, reduces prejudice by 20%. Social movements’ power—equity, justice, and reform—requires overcoming repression, misinformation, and inequity, leveraging technology and solidarity for inclusive, lasting change.
