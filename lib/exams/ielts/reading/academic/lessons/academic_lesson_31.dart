    'passage': '''
The global water crisis, characterized by scarcity, pollution, and unequal access, threatens billions. Water covers 71% of Earth, but only 2.5% is freshwater, with 1% accessible for human use. By 2030, demand will exceed supply by 40%, driven by population growth, industrialization, and climate change. Over 2 billion people lack safe drinking water, and 4 billion face severe scarcity yearly. Sub-Saharan Africa is hardest hit, with 70% of rural households lacking piped water. Agriculture, consuming 70% of global freshwater, exacerbates shortages, as irrigation inefficiencies waste 30% of water. Industrial runoff pollutes 50% of rivers, with 300 million tons of contaminants yearly, harming ecosystems and health. In India, 80% of surface water is unsafe, causing 400,000 deaths annually from waterborne diseases. Climate change intensifies droughts, reducing rainfall by 20% in arid regions, while floods contaminate 25% of freshwater sources. Urbanization strains infrastructure, with 60% of cities facing shortages. Solutions include rainwater harvesting, adopted by 10 million households in Asia, saving 15% of water. Desalination, producing 100 billion liters daily, meets 5% of global needs, but high energy costs limit access. Smart irrigation, using sensors, cuts waste by 25%, boosting yields by 20%. Wastewater recycling, treating 10% of urban sewage, supports industry and agriculture. Policy reforms, like the EU’s Water Framework Directive, protect 60% of water bodies, but enforcement fails in 30% of cases. Community-led initiatives, like Kenya’s sand dams, store 50 million liters yearly, benefiting 1 million people. Technology, such as AI-driven water management, optimizes distribution, reducing losses by 18%. Economic incentives, like water pricing, encourage conservation, though 40% of nations lack such policies. Privatization, managing 15% of global water, improves efficiency but raises costs, excluding 20% of low-income users. Education campaigns, reaching 500 million, promote conservation, with 65% adopting sustainable practices. International aid, like the UN’s 5 billion fund, supports infrastructure, but corruption diverts 25% of funds. Gender disparities persist, with women in 80% of water-scarce regions spending 6 hours daily fetching water, limiting education. Transboundary disputes, affecting 40% of rivers, hinder cooperation, as seen in the Nile Basin. The crisis demands integrated solutions—technology, policy, and equity—to ensure sustainable access, balancing human needs with environmental health for a resilient future.
