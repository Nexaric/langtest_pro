    'passage': '''
Agricultural innovations are transforming food production to feed a growing global population, projected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050. Precision farming leverages drones, sensors, and AI to monitor crops, optimizing water and fertilizer use, reducing waste by up to 20%. Vertical farming stacks crops in urban towers, using hydroponics to grow plants in nutrient-rich water, saving 90% of water compared to traditional methods. Aquaponics integrates fish farming, recycling nutrients between fish and plants, creating efficient, closed-loop systems. Genetic engineering, like CRISPR, develops drought-resistant or nutrient-enhanced crops, boosting food security in regions like Sub-Saharan Africa. Robotics automate planting and harvesting, addressing labor shortages in aging farming communities. Regenerative agriculture restores soil health through cover crops and reduced tillage, sequestering carbon to combat climate change. However, high costs of advanced technologies, often exceeding 100,000 for equipment, limit access for small-scale farmers, risking inequality. Ethical concerns, such as GMO safety, spark debates, with some fearing ecological impacts. Mobile apps deliver real-time weather and market data, empowering farmers. Scaling these innovations requires policy support and investment to ensure sustainable, equitable food systems that balance productivity with environmental health.
