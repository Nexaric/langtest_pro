    'passage': '''
Urban farming is revolutionizing food production in cities, addressing the challenges of a growing global population that strains traditional agriculture. As urban areas house over half the worldâ€™s population, innovative solutions like rooftop gardens, vertical farms, and hydroponics maximize limited space. Rooftop gardens transform unused city surfaces into productive plots, growing vegetables and herbs. Vertical farming stacks crops in controlled environments, using 90% less water than conventional methods. Hydroponics, a soil-less technique, relies on nutrient-rich water, enhancing efficiency. Aquaponics integrates fish farming, recycling nutrients between plants and fish, creating sustainable cycles. These systems reduce food miles, cutting carbon emissions by supplying local, fresh produce. Community gardens foster social cohesion, connecting residents and promoting mental well-being. Urban farming tackles food insecurity, providing affordable nutrition in underserved areas. Technologies like automated irrigation, sensors, and LED grow lights optimize yields, even in dense cities. Cities like Singapore and Detroit lead, integrating agriculture into urban planning. However, high startup costs and restrictive zoning laws challenge adoption. Small-scale farmers often lack access to advanced tools, risking inequality. Mobile apps empower farmers with data on weather and markets, but scaling these innovations globally requires investment and policy support. Urban farming promotes sustainability, reduces environmental impact, and builds resilient cities, reshaping food systems for an urbanized future.
