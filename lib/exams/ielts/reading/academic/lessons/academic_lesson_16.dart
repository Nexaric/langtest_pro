    'passage': '''
Social media has transformed communication, reshaping how people connect, share, and consume information globally. Emerging in the early 2000s with platforms like MySpace, it exploded with Facebook’s launch in 2004, now boasting over 3 billion monthly users across major platforms. Social media enables instant communication, fostering global communities and amplifying voices, from activists to influencers. Businesses leverage platforms for marketing, with 90% of companies using Instagram to engage customers. User-generated content, like TikTok videos, drives trends, shaping fashion, music, and politics. Algorithms personalize feeds, boosting engagement but creating echo chambers that reinforce biases. Social media’s impact on mental health is debated—studies link excessive use to anxiety in 30% of teens, though it also provides support networks. Politically, platforms spread information rapidly, but misinformation, like fake news during elections, affects 60% of users. Privacy concerns arise, with data breaches exposing millions, as seen in the 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal. Regulation efforts, like the EU’s GDPR, impose fines for violations, yet enforcement lags. Social media empowers marginalized groups, enabling movements like #MeToo, but cyberbullying affects 40% of young users. Innovations, such as augmented reality filters and live streaming, enhance interactivity, while AI moderates content, though not flawlessly. Economically, influencers generate 15 billion annually, creating new career paths. However, addiction to platforms, with users spending 2.5 hours daily, raises productivity concerns. Developing nations face access gaps, with only 30% of rural areas connected. Social media’s future hinges on balancing innovation, privacy, and mental health, requiring global cooperation to ensure equitable, safe digital spaces that foster connection without harm.
